# My Yazi configuration

This repo serves only to store my yazi configuration.

For now, plugins installed via the *ya* command should be ignored in this repo. A list of packages installed via *ya* is therefore contained in the .gitignore file. Additionally, all those packages are included in the package.toml file.

Path for configuration files (clone this repository there):

```
~/.config/yazi # Unix-like systems
C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\yazi\config\ # Windows
```

## Usage with ubuntu

Easiest way for me was to build from source.
Packages recommended to be installed in addition to yazi with their respective debian-package names:

```
$ sudo apt install ffmpegthumbnailer p7zip-full p7zip-rar jq poppler-utils fd-find ripgrep fzf zoxide imagemagick
```
