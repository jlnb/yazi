# My Yazi configuration

This repo serves only to store my yazi configuration.

For now, plugins installed via the *ya* command should be ignored in this repo. A list of packages installed via *ya* is therefore contained in the .gitignore file. Additionally, all those packages are included in the package.toml file.

If you pulled this repo the first time on a "new" machine, run the following commands.

´´´
ya pack -i
ya pack -u
´´´
to install and upgrade all packages.
